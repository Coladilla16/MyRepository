#MySimpleSurveys

We have created a simple survey web page using flask and different simple
methods obtained from the internet.

Functionalities:

- User account management
- Survey creation and removal
- Survey state managemen
- Survey answer collection
- Aggregated results display

*** Allow users to download their survey answers in CSV
*** Visualize the answers for each question in a simple bar chart




To simplify the css implementation we downloaded the materialize folder from
the following web page:
